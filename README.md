# android_app

This is the app to send heartbeat data to the web_backend that is also shared.
API will be documented and published as soon as I have time over on the other repository.

This app is only made for android and will be tested on Android 5.1 (Lolipop)
If you find a bug file a report or if you are helping me, put it in trello.
